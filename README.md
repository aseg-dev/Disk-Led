# Disk Led

------

## A cinnamon applet that shows disk activity with a blinking Led.

*From an idea of https://github.com/mdoege/hd-led_pygtk*

You can show or hide each disk activity using the menu.
New disks are recognized by Disk Led.

A dark and a light theme are available in the applet configuration.

You can launch up to 3 instances... or more by changing "max-instances" in metadata.json.

Available in several languages (de, es, fr, it), you can make your own translation...
